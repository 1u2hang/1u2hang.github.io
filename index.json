As short video platforms have gained popularity, these illicit contents have adapted to take the form of short videos,which we define as Short Video-Illicit promotional contents (SV-IPCs), becoming increasingly prevalent. Consequently, detecting SV-IPCs has become crucial in safeguarding users, especially minors, from fraudulent schemes and harmful contents. Existing detection schemes primarily focused on image processing, text analysis, and QR codes, making them ill-suited for short video platforms. To address this challenge, this paper presents the first comprehensive investigation into the SV-IPCs and their evasion techniques. By shedding light on the ecosystem underlying such illicit promotions, we propose a hybrid detection mechanism that combines natural language processing and video analysis techniques to deal with these emerging security challenges. Experimental results conducted on Chinese TikTok demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed scheme, achieving an impressive F1-score, recall, and precision of 90%, 90.9%, and 89.1%, respectively. Throughout the study, special attention is given to the potential implications of illicit promotion on short video platforms for both users and society as a whole.\n","date":1687824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687824000,"objectID":"284634dc8be960683fd3ec1736334fce","permalink":"https://anhzhang1994.github.io/project/svipc/","publishdate":"2023-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/svipc/","section":"project","summary":"Illicit promotional contents (IPCs) are advertising materials or campaigns that violate platform policies by employing deceptive, misleading, or fraudulent practices to promote products, services, or events.

On the internet, criminals substitute jargon for authentic terms to avoid censorship and discovery. Obfuscated language can avoid automatic and even manual detection because of its harmless appearance, but it must be comprehended by the intended audience. There has been a significant amount of research on English jargon, but little on Chinese jargon. We offer an overview of recent automatic Chinese jargon detection methods in this study.","tags":null,"title":"Detection Techniques for Chinese Jargon: A Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Yeonjoon Lee"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"69425fb10d4db090cfbd46854715582c","permalink":"https://anhzhang1994.github.io/publication/conference-paper/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"With the growth of netizens and the popularity of the Internet and smart devices, illicit promotional practitioners have been trending to promote online instead of offline. However, social media platform companies, operators, and government have their detection systems and censorship to solve such promotion. While they use newer techniques to deal with them, the illicit promotional practitioners also use newer techniques to evade the detection system and censorship; the process is like an adversarial process. In this paper, we look at this phenomenon and analyze how practitioners use techniques to do illicit promotion online and how to mitigate this phenomenon.","tags":null,"title":"Stealthy and Seductive: A Survey on Online Illicit Promotion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Hoon Ji","Υeonjoon Lee"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d6e6088f81e1b2f425d8eb99ae5a9e79","permalink":"https://anhzhang1994.github.io/publication/conference-paper2/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper2/","section":"publication","summary":"Eardrum segmentation is an important part of the field of medical image segmentation, aiming to help doctors make accurate diagnoses and reduce their workload.

In this paper, we investigate and analyze recent research related to deep learning on the eardrum segmentation scenario, introduce some basic background knowledge, and classify models, algorithms, and methods.
