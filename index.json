One such risk is illicit promotional content (IPC), which encompasses deceptive or fraudulent material intended to promote products, services, or events in violation of platform policies. As these platforms grow in popularity, so too does the threat of IPC, which has adapted to the short video format, referred to here as Short Video-Illicit Promotional Content (SV-IPC). The detection of SV-IPC is crucial to protect users, especially minors, from fraudulent schemes and harmful material. Current detection approaches primarily rely on image processing, text analysis, and QR code detection, limiting their effectiveness on short video platforms. This paper provides a comprehensive investigation into SV-IPC and its evasion techniques, revealing the underlying ecosystem of illicit promotion. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid detection framework that integrates natural language processing with video analysis. Extensive experiments conducted on Chinese TikTok validate the proposed scheme, demonstrating high effectiveness with an F1-score of 90.7\\%, recall of 90.3\\%, and precision of 91.2\\%. This study underscores the broader societal implications of SV-IPC and the importance of enhanced detection mechanisms.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding Illicit Promotional Contents on Short Video Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Tutorials\nPaper Writing\nMethods for Literature Reviews\nAcademic Writing for Graduate Students\nPhD 101\nApplying to Ph.D. Programs in Computer Science\nRanking\u0026amp;Profs\n10 easy ways to fail a Ph.D.\nQuality Research in Affordable Ways\nMatt Might’s blog\nResearch\nHCI\nSocial Media Mining\nMakeability Lab Handbook\nCybersecurity\nAI for Cybersecurity: A Handbook of Use Cases\ngwern.net\nAI\nUnderstand Deep Learning\nAI by Hand\nDive into Deep Learning\nConference\nRanking\nCORE\nCCF\nComputer Security Conference Ranking and Statistic\nTime\nCCF Deadline\nWikiCFP\n","date":1727654400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727654400,"objectID":"f7b5a6e5a85b9d88c8c128e3d4bfa8ae","permalink":"https://anhzhang1994.github.io/post/usefullinks/","publishdate":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/usefullinks/","section":"post","summary":"memo","tags":null,"title":"Useful Links","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Paper Reading Notes\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/AnhZhang1994/LiteratureNotes\nGitBook: https://lus-organization.gitbook.io/lu_paper_reading\n","date":1696032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696032000,"objectID":"2ed3e73b60bcfe8a2824a346fab16feb","permalink":"https://anhzhang1994.github.io/post/paperreading/","publishdate":"2023-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paperreading/","section":"post","summary":"My personal paper reading notes.","tags":null,"title":"Paper Reading Notes","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project of the team of Greenwashing, DSSGx@the University of Warwick, Summer 2023\nAbstract Greenwashing is a growing form of climate misinformation, designed to distract the public from the environmentally harmful activities of companies such as fossil fuel producers. Greenwashing strategies are typically subtle, not containing outright falsehoods but painting a misleading picture by emphasising environmentally beneficial activities while neglecting to communicate that the net effect of the company’s activities are negative. The subtle nature of these distracting tactics makes detection of greenwashing challenging. Leveraging the multimodal features of posts on social media, we built a machine learning-based pipeline for detecting Green Messaging and assessing the potential of companies engaging in Greenwashing\nPartners This project is a collaboration between Dr John Cook, Dr Geoffrey Supran, Algorithmic Transparency Institute and Data Science for Social Good Fellowship UK.\nContributors The Contributors are listed alphabetically.\nAllassan Tchangmena A Nken Bettina Roethlin Lu Zhang Manan Suri In collaboration with Project Manager: Senna Ma and Technical Mentor: James Tripp\n","date":1693094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693094400,"objectID":"db0e268893223009d82adb6085d4ffd0","permalink":"https://anhzhang1994.github.io/project/greenwashing/","publishdate":"2023-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/greenwashing/","section":"project","summary":"Project of the team of Greenwashing, DSSGx@the University of Warwick, Summer 2023\nAbstract Greenwashing is a growing form of climate misinformation, designed to distract the public from the environmentally harmful activities of companies such as fossil fuel producers.","tags":["Deep Learning","Social Media"],"title":"Towards Greenwashing Detection - a Deep Learning-Based Mechanism for Greenwashing Identification","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project of my master thesis@Hanyang University, 2023\nAbstract With the rapid expansion of wireless infrastructure and smart devices, short video platforms have become a staple of modern digital ecosystems, offering convenience but also introducing new risks.

On the internet, criminals substitute jargon for authentic terms to avoid censorship and discovery. Obfuscated language can avoid automatic and even manual detection because of its harmless appearance, but it must be comprehended by the intended audience.

However, social media platform companies, operators, and government have their detection systems and censorship to solve such promotion. While they use newer techniques to deal with them, the illicit promotional practitioners also use newer techniques to evade the detection system and censorship; the process is like an adversarial process. In this paper, we look at this phenomenon and analyze how practitioners use techniques to do illicit promotion online and how to mitigate this phenomenon.","tags":null,"title":"Stealthy and Seductive: A Survey on Online Illicit Promotion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Hoon Ji","Υeonjoon Lee"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d6e6088f81e1b2f425d8eb99ae5a9e79","permalink":"https://anhzhang1994.github.io/publication/conference-paper2/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper2/","section":"publication","summary":"Eardrum segmentation is an important part of the field of medical image segmentation, aiming to help doctors make accurate diagnoses and reduce their workload.
